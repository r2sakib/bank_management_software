# Bank Management System
The Project is aimed at solving the tasks required to run a bank. The project can be the central data hub of a bank, providing facilities in three layers. Firstly, a Manager Dashboard is provided so the creation, removal and modification of new customer, banker, manager, and account is possible. Secondly, a Cashier Dashboard is present so cashier at bank counter can provide facilities such as, cash deposit, cash withdrawal, fund transfer and balance checking. Thirdly, a Customer Dashboard is also present, which is comparable to online banking portal, where customers themselves and check on their accounts and perform fund transfer. All three of the managing elements is seamlessly connected and protected by a single login page, where when logging in a specific managing page is opened based on the role of the person within the system.
